 * allow look-up by collection-name without having to allocate a string as the
 * data-path will need to do collection validity checks with minimal penalty.
 *
 * The Manifest allows for an external manager to drive the lifetime of each
 * collection - adding, begin/complete of the deletion phase.
 *
 * This class is intended to be thread safe - the useage pattern is likely that
 * we will have many threads reading the collection state (i.e. policing
 * incoming database operations) whilst occasionally the collection state will
 * be changed by another thread calling "update" or "completeDeletion".
